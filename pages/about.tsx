            Kreative is a holding company, per say. A home for sometimes vastly
            different projects. What keeps it all together (besides the logo) is
            the goal of serving our customers, constituents, and community. Our
            shared mission, our through line, is to build organizations that aid
            the human condition. We&apos;re open to anything, trying everything,
            and striving for a world where Kreative has the opportunity and
            resources to advance problem solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our journey started in 2018, when Armaan opened Kreative (originally
            called The Creative Foundation, LLC) to start running hackathons for
            students in the Chicagoland area. Since then, we&apos;ve ran a few
            more, helped small businesses with their marketing, built AI-powered
            software for veterinarians, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            We haven&apos;t succeeded with everything and failure is a part of
            the journey. We&apos;re going to keep working.

            Kreative holds the idea that business can be one of the best ways to
            provide a service to those around us. By creating products that
            genuinely better the lives of our customers, we at Kreative can rest
            easy knowing we&apos;ve helped change somebody&apos;s life.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s this belief that drives us to look at each industry and
            service individually to assess what we can bring to the table and
            how we can integrate cross market services together to aid our
            customers in their own pursuits. Without the interests of our
            customers at the forefront of our organization, there is no value in
            existing.
