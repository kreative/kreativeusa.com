            Often, we are disappointed by the realities of our potential, but we
            forget that with a long enough timeline our potential is seemingly
            infinite.

              Kreative is a holding company, per say. A home for sometimes
              vastly different projects. What keeps it all together (besides the
              logo) is the goal of serving our customers, constituents, and
              community. Our shared mission, our through line, is to build
              organizations that aid the human condition. We&apos;re open to
              anything, trying everything, and striving for a world where
              Kreative has the opportunity and resources to advance problem
              solving.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey started in 2018, when Armaan opened Kreative
              (originally called The Creative Foundation, LLC) to start running
              hackathons for students in the Chicagoland area. Since then,
              we&apos;ve ran a few more, helped small businesses with their
              marketing, built AI-powered software for veterinarians, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              We haven&apos;t succeeded with everything and failure is a part of
              the journey. We&apos;re going to keep working.

              Kreative holds the idea that business can be one of the best ways
              to provide a service to those around us. By creating products that
              genuinely better the lives of our customers, we at Kreative can
              rest easy knowing we&apos;ve helped change somebody&apos;s life.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&apos;s this belief that drives us to look at each industry and
              service individually to assess what we can bring to the table and
              how we can integrate cross market services together to aid our
              customers in their own pursuits. Without the interests of our
              customers at the forefront of our organization, there is no value
              in existing.
