**Ames, IA:** HackIowaState, is a beginner-friendly 24-hour invention competition taking place at Iowa
State University between April 15th and April 16th. The event starts at 12 pm Saturday and is open to
all current Iowa State undergraduate and graduate students and is completely free to attend. Students
will be encouraged to craft solutions to problems they find meaningful over the course of the day. With
support from the Translational AI Center and Ivy College of Business, this hackathon will bring together
over 35 participants, including but not limited to Software Engineering, Computer Science,
Management Information Systems, and Electrical Engineering majors. 70 applications have already
been received from students to attend HackIowaState.

HackIowaState will feature three workshops, networking opportunities, as well as the chance to
compete for first, second, and third place. Winners will be rewarded with a certificate of honor.

“HackIowaState is an incredible opportunity for students to meet folks that can help take their ideas to
the next step. When you&apos;re constrained by a 24-hour period, you start finding ways to build your
project and filter out what&apos;s actually important and what&apos;s not,” said Armaan Gupta, the director for the
hackathon. “We&apos;re excited to see what Cyclones come up with on Sunday!”

The hackathon will take place between Saturday and Sunday for 24-hours straight, with participants
working solo or in teams. Judges will include professionals from Visionary, John Deere, Iowa DOT, and
Clayton Farms, as well as representatives from the Translational AI Center at Iowa State.
