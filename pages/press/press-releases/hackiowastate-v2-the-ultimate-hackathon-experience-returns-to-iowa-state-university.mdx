**Ames, IA:** Kreative Horizon is excited to announce the return of HackIowaState v2, the ultimate student invention competition experience at Iowa State University. This event offers students the opportunity to showcase their skills, solve real problems, and have fun all in one day.

HackIowaState v2 is not just about building and problem-solving; it's also about celebrating and empowering builders. Students will have the chance to network and collaborate with other participants through workshops, side quests, and ice breakers. This event is the perfect opportunity for students to try out their business, engineering, and design skills in a real-life setting while having a great time.

This event is the perfect opportunity for students to try out their business, engineering, and design skills in a real-life setting while having a great time.

The success of HackIowaState v1, which saw over 50 students from across Iowa State's campus participating, has paved the way for an even bigger and better HackIowaState v2. Projects built at the previous hackathon ranged from AI powered teaching tools to new apps for creating and tracking cocktails, showcasing the diverse talents of the participants.

HackIowaState v2 will take place over a span of 24 hours, providing participants with a dedicated and immersive experience. There is no limit to the number of teams that can participate, but team sizes are limited to a maximum of 4 people. Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis, so interested students are encouraged to sign up early to secure their spot.

The event is completely free for all participants and will be taking place from September 30th, 2023 at 12 pm to October 1st, 2023 at 12 pm, making it accessible to students of all backgrounds and interests. Whether you're a freshman just starting your journey at Iowa State or a graduate student looking to expand your skills, HackIowaState v2 welcomes everyone.

Kreative Horizon is proud to bring back HackIowaState v2, an event that not only fosters innovation and problem-solving but also creates a sense of community among builders. With the help of sponsors like the ISU Research Park, Ivy College of Business, and Visionary, HackIowaState v2 is set to be the highlight of the academic year! Join us and other students on campus for a day of building, celebrating, and empowering builders. We can't wait to see what incredible projects and ideas will emerge from this hackathon.
